# W6-WEATHER-DASH
Overview:
Weather dashboard website made so when you search a city it creates a new card with the current weather information from it. Actively shows colour depedning on the UV rating at the time. Saves previous searched cities and are clickable. 

Was definitely very challenging as doing the Group project at the same time. Watching YouTube videos was the biggest help for me as well as W3schools. Actually took a lot of inspiration for the project code I was working on with my team would help me with and had similar use to this weather dashboard. Working a lot of fetch API and creating innerHTML and for loops instead of multiple lines of coding. Loved working with bootstrap and will miss it dearly.
